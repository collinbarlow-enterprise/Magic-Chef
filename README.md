# Magic-Chef
AI powered recipe generation tool for the masses. Mobile first design, with a simple flow. Provide ingredients, cook time, you're desired cuisine, and watch the power of AI return a delicious idea. 

The time is now, to say no to the stress of uncertain dinner plans!

## Brief Description

I'm going to create an application that allows for a usesr to provide a list of ingredients, and submit that list to OpenAi, which will return a few recipes and one of those recipes will also have cooking instructions. 

Iteration One will include the ability to create, edit, and delete a pantry list, submit that list to OpenAi, then receive a recipe, which can be saved/deleted, and add notes/reviews to that recipe.
