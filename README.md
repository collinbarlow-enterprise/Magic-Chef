# Magic-Chef

# <strong><em> [Magic Chef])https://magic-chef.herokuapp.com/) </em></strong>: AI powered recipe generation tool with a mobile first design, and friendly user flow. All a user needs to do is provide a list of ingredients, and watch the power of AI return a delicious idea. 

The time is now, to say no to the stress of uncertain dinner plans!

## Magic Chef Overview

This website is very simple to use. After logging in, a user navigates to the New Pantry Page and adds a list of their ingredients.

![NewPantry Page](public/screenshots/NewPantryPage.png)
  
From there, they can create a recipe with a single button click, and once the recipe returns they are redirected to the AllRecipes Page. This stores all of a user's recipes, where they can delete, or move into the details page.

The Details Page, explains the recipe's instructions, and has the functionality for a user to make notes on said recipe. Giving them the option to tweak and make the recipe their own.

 ## Next Steps:

1. Add conditional rendering for a more dynamic UI
2. Refine the AI Prompt to be more specific/instructional
3. Have the AI Prompt return a structured response that can involve more data destructuing (cuisine, other recipe recommendations, common ingredients to add that would elevate the recipe)
4. Implement a forum component that allows a user to share their recipes, and comment on other users' recipes. 
5. Finesse the styling
